      "It was also important to us how convenient the interaction would be on both sides. However, in favour of speed, the first version of verification was launched without any preliminary tests. For this reason, the performers' user flow was overgrown with a lot of trivial functions, and its steps included not only ordering a service and paying for it, but also searching for a photographer, communicating with a manager, and setting up the display.",
      "The product was supposed to make money from this, but a simple check of photos and parameters by moderators wouldn't have been able to recoup all the costs of this task. Among other things, we wouldn't have been able to give guarantees to customers that they wouldn't be visited by a scammer pretending to be someone else.",
      "That's why we decided to partner with photo studios and do turnkey verification. Thanks to this, we couldn't only control all the processes but also sell them at a more profitable cost. Thus, the client got the professional work of the photographer and manager when ordering the service.",
