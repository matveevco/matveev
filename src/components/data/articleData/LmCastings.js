      "Regardless of its scale, every product has a key feature, which is its foundation. That feature, or rather a unique feature of Linkmuse, was the castings.",

      "First of all, we clustered the problems and their priority, conducted additional qualitative research and conducted a competitive analysis of platforms with similar functionality.",
      "It was important not to delay the implementation of the solution, as activity rates were dropping from week to week, so the formulation of the scope of work and decomposition of the task was done in parallel with data collection. Much of the discussion centred around two themes: «What can we improve?» and «What can we offer?».",
      "The answers to these questions weren't long in coming. Improvements had to address the stages of creating castings and responses to them, the processes for dealing with responses, and the search and filtering of content in the listing.",
      "The proposals were related to monetisation or rather paid promotion of castings from customers and responses from performers. The hypothesis implied a significant increase in reach and views by holding the first positions in the listings.",

Endless forms and steps, lack of hints and confusing scenarios, sometimes leading after the creation of a casting to a personal account, potentially affected the overall satisfaction of using the service.",
      "So, we revised and prioritised all the fields and optimised the steps. In addition, we added tooltips based on frequently asked questions. The hints were supposed to greatly simplify the creation of the casting and, in the long run, play an important role in gamification.",
